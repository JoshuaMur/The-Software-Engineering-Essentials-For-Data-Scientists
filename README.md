# The-Software-Engineering-Essentials-For-Data-Scientists
A Series like project of Essential Software Engineering Concepts for a Machine Learning Engineer or/and Data Scientist implementing AI systems.

This is a series of tutorials and projects focused on software engineering concepts for data scientists. While learning data science and machine learning can make it easy to not focus on software engineering tools and techniques, it is still important for data scientists to understand software engineering concepts in order to effectively implement machine learning-based systems or AI powered sytems.

In this series, we will cover topics such as system design, data structures and algorithms, design patterns, unit and functional testing, event-driven architecture, memory optimization etc. We will approach these topics from a data science perspective, making it accessible for other data scientists in the future who want to learn software engineering concepts and still relate.

Each tutorial will include a project that demonstrates the concepts covered. The code for each project will be available on this Github repository.
