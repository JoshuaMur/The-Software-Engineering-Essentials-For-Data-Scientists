# The-Software-Engineering-Essentials-For-Data-Scientists
A Series like project of Essential Software Engineering Concepts for a Machine Learning Engineer or/and Data Scientist implementing AI systems.

This is a series of tutorials and projects focused on software engineering concepts for data scientists. While learning data science and machine learning can make it easy to not focus on software engineering tools and techniques, it is still important for data scientists to understand software engineering concepts in order to effectively implement machine learning-based systems or AI powered sytems.

In this series, we will cover topics such as system design, data structures and algorithms, design patterns, unit and functional testing, event-driven architecture, memory optimization etc. We will approach these topics from a data science perspective, making it accessible for other data scientists in the future who want to learn software engineering concepts and still relate.

Each tutorial will include a project that demonstrates the concepts covered. The code for each project will be available on this Github repository.
Stay connected with me here on Github https://github.com/JoshuaMur and on Twitter https://twitter.com/MurJoshua to keep up with the series.


# Table of Contents
● Introduction to Software Engineering Concepts for Data Scientists

● Data Structures and Algorithms for Data Scientists

● Design Patterns for Data Scientists

● Unit and Functional Testing for Data Scientists

● Event-Driven Architecture for Data Scientists

● Memory Optimization for Data Scientists

● System Design for Data Scientists


# Who Is This For?

This series is for data scientists and machine learning engineers who want to learn software engineering concepts to improve their machine learning implementation skills. The concepts will be explained in a way that is easy to understand for those who do not have exactly a software engineering background but work as data scientists and with data science tools.


# How To Use This Repository
Each concept will have its own folder with code examples, explanations, and resources. The code examples will be written in Python, but the concepts are applicable to other programming languages as well.

# Contributions
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to submit a pull request.

### To sum it up
I'm creating this series of software engineering concepts specifically for data scientists. After recognizing the importance of software engineering skills for building scalable and robust machine learning based systems. The series will cover concepts like sytem design, data structures and algorithms, design patterns, unit and functional testing, event-driven architecture, memory optimization, etc. The goal is to keep it all in the data science perspective so that data scientists can easily pick up these skills. The code examples will be in Python, but the concepts are applicable to other programming languages as well. Contributions to the project are welcome, and the project will be hosted on Github.
